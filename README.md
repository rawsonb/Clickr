# Clickr

An autoclicker made with Rust and Tauri.
This is basically the first piece of software I've ever written. It *should allow you to set a keybind, click speed (cps), and randomizing range (rng). All of these things work on my end, and they *should work on any os. I still haven't made the builds because there is no cross compilation for tauri, meaning I have to hunt down a computer for each os.

*Probably won't, though.
