An autoclicker made with Rust and Tauri.
This is basically the first piece of software I've ever written. It *should allow you to set a keybind, click speed (cps), and randomizing range (rng). All of these things work on my end, and they *should work on any os. I still haven't made the build for osx because I need a mac & don't have one.

.deb and appimage: https://github.com/rawsonb/Clickr/releases/tag/v1.0

*Probably won't, though.
